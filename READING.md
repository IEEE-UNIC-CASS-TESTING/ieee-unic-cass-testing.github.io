# Reading Materials

## Types of Testing Equipment
- **Multimeter**: Measures electrical properties like voltage, current, and resistance.
- **LCR Meter**: Measures the inductance (L), capacitance (C), and resistance (R) of electronic components.
- **Oscilloscope**: Visualizes varying signal voltages, showing their waveform over time.
- **Power Supply**: Provides adjustable voltage and current to power electronic circuits during testing.
- **Function Generator**: Produces various electrical waveforms over a range of frequencies.
- **Logic Analyzer**: Captures and displays digital signals, helping in debugging digital circuits.
- **Spectrum Analyzer**: Measures the magnitude of an input signal versus frequency within the full frequency range of the instrument.
